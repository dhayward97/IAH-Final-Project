  <h1>Alien Synopsis</h1>
<p>In the film, space travel has gone commercial. The crew of a cargo ship land on the moon to investigate a distress call. They are unable to find anything and return to their ship. To their horror, they discover an alien has boarded their ship and is hunting them down. Some crew members manage to make it off the ship in an escape pod, however the alien also got onto the pod. The main character, Ripley, fights the alien, eventually blasting it into outer space.

<h1> Summary</h1>
<p>In Alien, extraterrestrial life is portrayed in a malicious way. The film is very gruesome as the alien kills many of the crew members. In one particular scene, an alien comes out of a man’s stomach, ripping him in half. On top of violence, the lighting and music in the entire movie give it an eerie feeling, similar to a traditional horror film. Independence Day, while violent, is much less gruesome. It is also an action/thriller film, so it does not have the same horror aspects as Alien. While these two films have massive differences, the commonality between them is aliens are trying to kill humans. In whatever genre, humans being killed by aliens portrays them as a threat. These two works portray aliens as something to fear, not something to excitedly await.

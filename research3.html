  <h1>Arrival Synopsis</h1>
  <p>Alien spaceships hover over several countries around the globe. Governments send scientists to study the crafts and investigate why they have come to Earth. The main character and linguist, Louise Banks, boards one of the ships to try to communicate with the aliens. She and her partner are approached by ginormous, squid-like creatures who draw symbols in the air. As the film progresses, the characters decipher the symbols and figure out the language allows humans to look into the future. It is revealed the aliens taught humans the language because they will need man's help in the future.

<h1> Contact Synopsis</h1>
<p>An astronomer named Ellie Arroway spends her career and life looking for proof of aliens. She works for the SETI program at an Array in New Mexico searching for radio signals from outer space. Throughout the film, many people doubt her and the existence of aliens. Just before SETI was about to shut down her project, Arroway discovers a signal coming from light years away. When news of the signal breaks, people are both excited and afraid. The US government forms a task force to decipher the signal, which includes Ellie. Arroway deciphers the signal and finds out it is an alien blueprint for a space traveling device. Upon completing and using the device, it is revealed this signal is sent to every intelligent species in the universe as a way to help them advance.

<h1> Summary</h1>
<p>In both Contact and Arrival, aliens are portrayed as mysterious yet helpful beings. While aliens are not actually shown in Contact, their existence is a main theme in the movie. Initially people are both excited and terrified about the discovery. It is not until the alien signal is deciphered that peopleâ€™s fears dissipate. In Arrival, aliens landed on Earth and the population was mortified. Although people feared the aliens at first, once communication had been established the fear vanished. It is not aliens people fear, but the unknown.
